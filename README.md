# quote-generator
A Random Quote Generator is capable of pulling quotes randomly from an API, a database, or simply from an array. We will be designing a Random Quote Generator from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and type.fit API. The webpage displays a random quote from a collection and upon the click of a button, it randomly generates a new quote. 
# About
This is a simple web application that generates a random quote from a collection of quotes fetched from the type.fit API. The user can click a button to generate a new random quote.

# How to use it
You can try the Random Quote Generator by opening the index.html file in your web browser. This will load the Random Quote Generator page and display a quote and author. To generate a new random quote, simply click the New Quote button.

# How it works
The Random Quote Generator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quotes are fetched from the type.fit API using the fetch API in JavaScript. When the page is loaded or the New Quote button is clicked, a JavaScript function is called that fetches a new quote from the API, selects a random quote from the response, and displays it on the page.

The Random Quote Generator also features a tweet button that allows the user to tweet the quote and author using the Twitter API. To use the tweet button, simply click the Tweet Quote button.

# Technologies used
